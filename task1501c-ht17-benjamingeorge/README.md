# Task1501c

## Description
This mini-project uses an Arduino Due card along with an LCD shield with some push buttons.
Depending on which button is pressed, an analog voltage is obtained which is then read with an A/D converter in the SAM3XE controller. The program responds to the keystroke and prints on the display which button is pressed. 

## Equipment:
- Arduino Due
- LCD shield for Arduino
